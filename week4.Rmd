# **Centered LaTeX equation**   

These equations such  as $a= 3+ 4$ will appear inside of a single line of text. 

These equations such  $$ a= 3+ 4  $$ will appear in separate line of their own.

#### **Miscellaneous**   

In line execution of r inside the backticks by inserting r as the first element `r 3 +pi`


```
everything here is in a plaintext.
even single line.
usfel especially when showing other coding instructions.
```

####  **Subscripts**

$$H_0=Z_{a+b}$$


####  **Superscripts**

$$s= cA^z$$

Elements can be coupled and nested.
$$ s=cA^z_1+z_2{2+ x}$$

####  **Fractions and Greek symbols**

$$\alpha= \frac{\beta}{\delta+\gamma_x}$$


####  **Summation signs**
$$z=\sum_{i=1}^x{k}$$

####   **Escape the backslash with a custome term**


$$\backslash \alpha \le b \backslash$$

####   **Rendering plaintext in a LaTex equatin**

$$P(Occuurence of Species A)= Z$$

$$P(\mbox{Occurrence of Species A})=z$$

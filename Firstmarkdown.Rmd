We defined the `add` function to 
compute the sum of two numbers.
    
# Fencing
in line fencing with a backtick `to show anything in a plain text with *no* formatting`

in line execution of r inside the backticks by inserting r as the first element `r 3 +pi`

3 backticks for a whole section of plain text
```
everything here is in a plaintext.
even single line.
usfel especially when showing other coding instructions.

# LaTeX code for equations
 we set off the equation with `$`for brackets.
## in-Line-equations

These equations such  as $a= 3+ 4$ will appear inside of a single line of text. 

These equations such  $$ a= 3+ 4  $$ will appear in seperate line of thir own.


##  Subscripts

$$H_0=Z_{a+b}$$


## Superscripts

$$s= cA^z$$

Elements can be coupled and nested.
$$ s=cA^z_1+z_2{2+ x}$$

##  Fractions and Greek symbols

$$\alpha= \frac{\beta}{\delta+\gamma_x}$$


## Summation signs
$$z=\sum_{i=1}^x{k}$$

##  Escape the backslash with a custome term


$$\backslash \alpha \le b \backslash$$

##  Rendering plaintext in a LaTex equatin

$$P(Occuurence of Species A)= Z$$

$$P(\mbox{Occurrence of Species A})=z$$
